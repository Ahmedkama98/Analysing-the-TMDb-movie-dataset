## Project Overview

In this notebook, I'm trying to analyze the TMDb movie dataset to answer some questions I asked about it using some statistics and visualization methods and some tools like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Questions to Answer

- [Which Movie Has The Highest Or Lowest Profit?](#question-1)
- [Which movie has the highest runtime and which has the shortest runtime?](#question-2)
- [Which year has the highest release of movies?](#question-3)
- [Is more budget led to more revenue?](#question-4)

## Tools Used

- Python 3.0
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Data Wrangling

In this step, I just chose the dataset that I'm interested in, and then I downloaded it on my machine, then uploaded it to this notebook. I will use "tmdb-movies.csv" dataset file.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this step, I will research for my Question.

## Conclusions

After analyzing these data, I found some insights, and they are: Some Recommendations could I give to movies producers:

- A successful movie should have a budget of about 15 million dollars.
- A successful movie should be released in months 9, 10, 11.
- It's better to make Woody Allen, or Clint Eastwood, or Martin Scorsese produce your movie.
- A successful movie has a runtime of about 113 minutes.

Some insights I get from my analysis 'Avatar', 'Star Wars' and 'Titanic' are the most profitable movies.
Maximum Number Of Movies Release In year 2014.
Average runtime of the movies are decreasing year by year.

## Limitations

All results are limited to the original data set and has no advanced statistics were performed, the results can only be treated as indicators and are not generalizable.

We have used TMBD Movies dataset for our analysis and worked with popularity, revenue, and runtime. Our analysis is limited to only the provided dataset. For example, the dataset does not confirm that every release of every director is listed.
